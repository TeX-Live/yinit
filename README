This is the yinit font, Old German decorative capital letters (only),
created as a Metafont font by Yannis Haralambous ca.1994, version of
2015/01/09.  It is released to the public domain.

The yinit.pdf font chart was created by running (more or less):
  mf '\mode:=ljfour;input yinit' && gftopk yinit
  echo '\table\end' | tex testfont
  dvips testfont && ps2pdf testfont.ps yinit.pdf
There is no other documentation (available or needed).

Historical note 1: Andreas Schrell made a modified driver file,
yinitas.mf, and a LaTeX file initials.sty.  These are now available on
CTAN separate from this directory (they used to be merged together).

Historical note 2: since inception, TeX Live contained a stub driver
file, yinitdd.mf, which merely generated the letter D.  At Yannis'
suggestion, it has now been removed.

Historical note 3: yinit was re-uploaded to CTAN in January 2015 by
Karl Berry, including this README, after discussions with Yannis about
the license and other points above.  No changes to the actual font,
either metrics or glyphs, but because of the license clarification,
the release date/version is explicitly mentioned above.
