Created by Yannis Haralambous ca. 1994 as Metafont font.
The OTF font was created by Yannis Haralambous using 
the excellent [mf2pt1](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/mf2pt1)
with only tiny bugfixes afterwards.
The Yinit.ttf font was created from the OTF font using fontforge
by Said Achmiz (https://www.saidachmiz.net/). The font was then
split into one font file per character to make it easier to be used
on web sites. See the sample yinit.css in outline/split-for-web/.
The splitting was done by Gwern Branwen (github gwern),
see https://github.com/TeX-Live/yinit/issues/1


Usage
-----

Usage of the OTF/TTF font
-------------------------
Install the fonts in a directory that TeX searches for fonts, then
use `fontspec', eg in LaTeX:

```
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont{Yinit}
```

Remarks
=======

The yinit.pdf font chart was created by running (more or less):
  mf '\mode:=ljfour;input yinit' && gftopk yinit.600pk
  echo '\table\end' | tex testfont
  dvips testfont && ps2pdf testfont.ps yinit.pdf
There is no other documentation (available or needed).

Historical note 1: Andreas Schrell made a modified driver file,
yinitas.mf, and a LaTeX file initials.sty.  These are now available on
CTAN separate from this directory (they used to be merged together).

Historical note 2: since inception, TeX Live contained a stub driver
file, yinitdd.mf, which merely generated the letter D.  At Yannis'
suggestion, it has now been removed.

Historical note 3: yinit was re-uploaded to CTAN in January 2015 by
Karl Berry, including this README, after discussions with Yannis about
the license and other points above.  No changes to the actual font,
either metrics or glyphs, but because of the license clarification,
the release date/version is explicitly mentioned above.


Changes after 2015
==================

20190307

Inclusion of the OTF font (CTAN package yinit-otf), as well as TTF
variants and TTF split by character fonts.


20190124

In agreement with Yannis Haralambous, the following changes were made
to allow using yinit fonts with dropcaps package. The changes are
- changing the font identifier to YINIT from CMR
- changing the font size to the correct value instead of 10pt#

Development has moved to Github: https://github.com/TeX-Live/yinit
