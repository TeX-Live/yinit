The Yinit.ttf font was created from the OTF font using fontforge
by Said Achmiz (https://www.saidachmiz.net/). The font was then
split into one font file per character to make it easier to be used
on web sites. The splitting was done by Gwern Branwen (github gwern),
see https://github.com/TeX-Live/yinit/issues/1

All the files are under the same license as yinit itself, that is
Public Domain.
